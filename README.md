TODO:

- make zoom only work for chart, make axis scale
- make filtration by score?
- cross reference ssbmrank?
- warning if user wants to load too many players
- lines get thinner on zoom
- optimize performance
- hover to see player name, liquipedia(?)
- filter by improvement rate, jumps, rank
- get rid of line ups from zero (new challenger approaches?)
- cross reference tournament dates
- individual player search
